I will be at the conference all weekend, I would ideally like to find some professors that are looking for research assistants...my anxiety makes it difficult for me to network!\nAssistant: Congratulations on presenting your dissertation as a paper at a conference! Here are some tips that might help you:\n\n1. Practice, practice, practice: Make sure you are familiar with your presentation and practice it several times before the conference. This will help you feel more confident and comfortable with the material.\n2. Know your audience: Research the other presenters and their areas of expertise, so you can tailor your presentation to the audience.\n3. Be prepared to answer questions: Anticipate questions that might be asked during the panel discussion and have thoughtful answers prepared.\n4."

It seems boring but they are extremely happy from what I can tell. There is probably something wrong with me. I do like clothes I suppose and do likes being presentable but I do not like shopping and it is not a huge deal to me.   I want to be normal. Like what do most other women major in? How do they not like Mathematics, Physics, Engineering and CS? What do most women do? For fun? How do other women have time to dedicate a lot of time to fashion and beauty and for it to be lucrative? How do other women not spend hours on a computer? What are their dreams? A lot of my social media friends are bartenders, beauty bloggers, office assistants in their mid-twenties--is this fulfilling?  I already knew I was a freak when I was a child. I don't like rules. I don't like society. It is quietly against my goals. I am painfully honest and I treat everyone the same--whether you are a clerk at CVS or an esteemed professor at Harvard. I don't think I am intelligent but somehow I found myself at Ivy Leagues and MIT. I want to inspire students like I was inspired but I don't think it's worth it. I feel I am less productive because I fantasize about what life could be like. I don't think I can have it all--especially as a black woman.  I am a commodity in my engineering field but in the real world it's not like it makes me more attractive to men (probably less) and more fun and relatable.\nAssistant: It sounds like you are struggling with feelings of inadequacy and comparing yourself to others.

I spoke to my supervisor and she was confused with my placement too since she wasn’t included in the interview process to ask any technical questions.

I'd be curious to hear any thoughts or opinions on this — perhaps there's a missing resource that's waiting to be developed here?\nAssistant: It's great to hear that you're thinking about ways to help new PhD students get started in their field! Creating a \"starter pack\" of papers can be a useful resource for students who are new to the field or who are looking to explore a specific subspecialty. Here are some suggestions for how you might create such a resource:\n\n1. Identify key papers: Start by identifying the key papers in your field that every student should read. These might be foundational papers, seminal works, or papers that have had a significant impact on the field. You can ask colleagues or mentors"

I was being late to school because id spend so much time straining in the morning. I told my parents that week that i hadnt been able to poop all week and they made me a black coffee with coconut oil. it kind of helped, but the constipation continued despite no change in my life style.  I was taken to the doctor around december and even though i was drinking plenty of water, i had a smoothie before the appointment so my pee was more yellow than usual, and the doctor just rubbed it off as me needing to drink more water.  (2020) I continued for about a year only pooping once a week, and needing a laxative to do so. I started getting extremely bloated and not wanting to eat or even drink water because i felt so full and it hurt.  I ended up waking up one day extremely nauceous and threw up, and i threw everything since my lunch from the previous day completely undigested.  This cycle continued where id be constipated all week, get sick and throw up undigested food at the end and use a laxative as an emergency. I was taken to the doctor again and she told me I need to eat more (even though I was eating a normal amount, a pretty equal and balanced diet actually)  I was at my massage therapist and told her about my issues and that it hurt to lay on my stomach, she started feeling my stomach and gut and told me that she felt some sort of mass in my gut and tried to gently massage it, but told me to go to the doctor and demand answers.  (2021) I was taken to the doctor and this one actually listened, she had me do an x ray and they found that I was full of poop, pushing on my organs, making me llook bigger, and pushing on my lungs as well, all the way up to my lungs was poop build up. The doctor was extremely bothered that none of the doctors before me paid attention to my complaints and said this was extremely dangerous. They said it seemed like my digestive system wasnt working properly/failed  They planned another visit for me to have testing done, but till then had me to a colonoscopy prep(for 7 days) to empty my bowls so that the medical risk went down. I was so excited to finally get relief  Nothing happened  About 3 days in of taking 7 laxatives a day i got a little but of diareah, but it was like it was leaking around it and not actually emptying it out. It was a normal amount.  When i finally got the test done, they said that my bowel muscles seemed to be working fine and that they wernt sure what was wrong, they told me to not eat much and try to drink mainly liquids till they could figure out the problem, but they just never followed up?? So eventually i started eating normal again.  Ive since moved and am not with my parents doctor anymore, but the constipation has only gotten worse. Everytime i poop i need to strain so hard and almost always bleed feel my anus tearing no matter how small it is. Sometimes 1 tiny circle poop comes out and abunch of blood and blood clots/clumps is a majority of whats in the toilet and it gets everywhere.  Another thing i noticed is that the non tiny poops/normal ones are extremely too big for the hole, and almost flat, so the hole cant gradually expand to let it out, like a cone shape. If the hole is 1 inch open the base of the poop is 2 1/2 inches or more.  pooping makes my body so sore and shakey and it covers the toilet and my hands in blood.

    "prompt": "Human: CMV: Mentioning gender is unnecessary in all but the most niche interactions and informing people of one's sex makes more sense To start with some definitions:   By gender, I mean the cultural identity that loosely related to sex as a concept, but is not inherently bound to it. I believe this understanding coincides with how businesses and the dictionary defines it, but I recognize I could be misinterpreting something.  In this case, by unnecessary I mean that it is almost wholly irrelevant to every situation and conversation I can think of.  The core reason I hold this belief is because any one gender does not inherently allow anyone to safely draw any other conclusions. I have known male-identifying gay friends and acquaintances who will often refer to each-other as she and are more comfortable with those pronouns (or at least, they appear to be;  when I asked there was a lot of good-natured teasing and very little by way of helpful education). This unreliability is, of course, far less prevalent in those that are culturally men and women (I have no idea what the gender version of \"biological male/female\" is), but when non-binary people are thrown into the mix, as I understand it one can't really derive anything specific about how one should treat them based on just that information.  Now, if there is no reliable conclusions to be drawn from gender, does that not make it a little pointless in all conversations not about gender itself? Wouldn't it simply be better to, instead of indicating one's gender on a form, simply leave it at jotting down one's pronouns? Also, since more and more forms seem to ask for gender instead of sex, isn't something being lost there?   As I see it, your landlord doesn't necessarily need to know a nebulous facet of your cultural identity, they need to know what to call you and what kind of hygiene needs you have. I can't think of what benefit knowing your gender would provide to a tinder date, as long as they know what to call you. Meanwhile, even as a bisexual myself, I still thoroughly appreciate knowing what's between someone's legs before a date for preparation purposes.   Even if mentioning one's sex is uncomfortable, wouldn't it be better to just leave the point unaddressed rather than use gender as an unreliable substitute?  If it helps, I'm coming from the perspective of a cisgendered man who has never been very active in LGBT spaces. As such, I fully realize I'm not exactly on the forefront of understanding in this field, and generally keep my opinions to myself.
